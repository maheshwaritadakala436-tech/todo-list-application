What I Built ?
I built a simple console based To-Do List Manager in python.The code allows users to add,remove and view tasks,and it persists the tasks in a file named tasks.txt

# Why I Built it ?
I buit this To-Do List Manager to meet the requirements specified, which included :

. Creating a console-based application

. Implementing basic to-do list functionality(add,remove,view tasks)

. Persisting tasks in a file

. Providing a simple and intuitive user interface

# How I Built it ?
I built the To-Do List Manager by :

1 Using a list to store tasks in memory and a tasks.txt file for persistence

2 Defining functtions for loading and saving tasks (load_tasks and save_tasks)

3 Implementing task management functions (add_task,remove_task and view_tasks)

4 Creating a simple command-line interface using a while loop and input statements

5 Adding error handling using try-except blocks

This approach allowed me to build a functional and user-friendly To-Do List Manager that meets the requirements

# Overview
Overall, the code meets all the specified requirements and provides a basic , persistent CLI to-do list application
